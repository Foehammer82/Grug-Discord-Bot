This includes receiving updates about members joining, leaving, or updating their presence or profile in the guilds (servers) the bot is part of. Specifically, for the Grug app, the <code>members</code> intent is necessary for several reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Initializing Guild Members: When the bot starts and loads guilds, it initializes guild members by creating    Discord accounts for them in the Grug database. This process requires access to the list of members in each guild.</li> <li>Attendance Tracking: The bot tracks attendance for events. To do this effectively, it needs to know about all    members in the guild, especially to send reminders or updates about events.</li> <li>Food Scheduling: Similar to attendance tracking, food scheduling involves assigning and reminding members about    their responsibilities. The bot needs to know who the members are to manage this feature.</li> <li>User Account Management: The bot manages user accounts, including adding new users when they join the guild and    updating user information. The <code>members</code> intent allows the bot to receive events related to these activities.</li> </ol> <p>Without the <code>members</code> intent, the bot would not be able to access detailed information about guild members, which would significantly limit its functionality related to user and event management.</p>"},{"location":"about/privacy_policy/","title":"Privacy policy","text":""},{"location":"about/privacy_policy/#privacy-policy","title":"Privacy Policy","text":""},{"location":"about/privacy_policy/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Grug is committed to protecting your privacy.
